# webpack-simple

> A Vue.js project

This was generated with the vue-cli tool: `vue init <template> <project name>`.
In this project, I used the `webpack-simple` template

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
